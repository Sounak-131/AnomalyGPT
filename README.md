## Overview

AnomalyGPT is a large vision-language model (LVLM) framework designed for industrial anomaly detection, combining the interpretability of natural language with powerful visual reasoning. Built on top of pretrained components such as ImageBind, Vicuna-7B, and PandaGPT, AnomalyGPT can detect and localize visual defects in manufacturing objects using both textual prompts and support images.

Unlike traditional anomaly detectors that rely on handcrafted features or dense patch comparisons, AnomalyGPT leverages the strengths of Large Language Models to generate natural language justifications and detailed pixel-level anomaly maps.
